ANGULAR
-application design framework
-frontend framework with JS, makes efficient single page apps

-Used to create single page apps that run on the client
-can be used to create full stack apps by making
HTTP requests to backend server
-Angular can run on the server side with something
like Angular Universal

This is Angular 2, completely rewritten from 1

Why Angular:
-dynamic frontend apps and UIs 
-more full featured than react, so tougher and larger
-uses typescript by default
-RxJS library, lets use of observables

Component driven 
ex:
@Component({
    selector: 'app-hero-list',
    templateUrl: './hero-list.component.html',
    providers: [HeroService]
})
export class HeroListComponent implements OnInit{ /*...*/ }

Angular distinguishes components from services
this increases modularity and reusability

by separating a components view related functionality
from other kinds of processing, you can make your component
classes lean and efficient

a component can delegate certain tasks to services, such as fetching
data from the server, validating user input, or logging directly
to the console

Angular CLI:
  npm install -g @angular/cli
  ng new my-app 

commands available to generate components/services
